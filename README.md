# filmProject
film project I created in my university course
The assessment for this unit entails development of a film database web application. The web 
application will allow users to browse and search through the film database and perform CRUD 
operations. The web application you develop will exchange data in JSON and XML format 
through a RESTful webservice.
The purpose is to demonstrate your ability to create and test differing formats of web services, 
to retrieve and parse data in a variety of formats and finally be able to consume web services in 
order to implement a functional web application.
